# History

Completed work with the context that git history alone can't capture: decisions made, alternatives rejected, surprises encountered.

When a task in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is finished, its entry moves here — extended with what was actually shipped, what was decided during implementation, and anything a future session (or future-you) would want to know before building on top of it.

Entries are chronological with **newest at the top**.

## Format

One section per completed task.

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD · Short title

- **What shipped:** the outcome in one or two sentences
- **Why:** the motivation (carried over from the TODO entry)
- **Decisions:** key choices made during implementation, with brief reasoning
  - *Chose X over Y because …*
- **Alternatives considered:** options explicitly looked at and rejected, with the rejection reason
- **Surprises / lessons:** anything discovered during the work that's worth remembering
- **Touches:** files / folders changed (commit SHAs optional)
- **Source:** originating TODO entry or ad-hoc note
```

Not every field is required for every entry — a small bug fix may only need *What shipped / Decisions / Touches*. Use judgement; the goal is future-useful context, not bureaucracy.

### 2026-04-23 · Core types & seeded RNG

- **What shipped:**
  - `src/util/rng.ts` — a deterministic seeded PRNG (`createRng(seed)`) with `next / int / pick / shuffle / weighted` helpers.
  - `src/util/__tests__/rng.test.ts` — 22 tests covering determinism, range, uniformity, bounds, permutation, non-mutation, weight proportion, and edge cases.
  - `src/combat/types.ts` — the `Stats` interface (`hp`, `attack`, `defense`, `speed`).
- **Why:** every downstream core module needs shared types and deterministic randomness. Tests that exercise RNG-driven logic can't assert anything without a reproducible sequence.
- **Decisions:**
  - *Scoped this task to RNG + `Stats` only.* Other types named in the TODO entry (Hero, Class, Ability, Enemy, Pack, RunState, Roster, SaveFile) were **deferred** to their owning tasks. Empty stubs now would be speculative — the real shape comes from the first code that uses them, and would have needed rewriting.
  - *Chose mulberry32* for the PRNG: small, fast, well-known, adequate statistical quality for a game (not a cryptographic context). No dependency added.
  - *Factory function (`createRng(seed)`) over a class.* Closure-over-state keeps the API small; no `new`, no `this`.
  - *`Stats` lives in `src/combat/types.ts`, not `src/heroes/types.ts`.* Both heroes and enemies have stats, and combat is the primary consumer — placing stats under heroes would leave enemies orphaned.
  - *`weighted()` takes `{ value, weight }` objects* rather than parallel arrays — self-documenting at call sites.
  - *Explicit throws on empty input* (`rng.pick([])`, `rng.weighted([])`, zero total weight). Silent `undefined` returns would cause mysterious downstream failures.
- **Alternatives considered:**
  - *Creating all 8 type stubs up front.* Rejected — speculative abstraction; types would be reshaped by their first real consumer.
  - *Class-based RNG (`new Rng(seed)`).* Rejected in favor of the factory for simpler API surface.
  - *xoshiro / splitmix64.* Rejected — mulberry32 is easier to audit in a few lines and is well within the quality needed for dice-roll use.
- **Surprises / lessons:**
  - Some tests passed on their first green run because their assertions were inherent properties of a correct mulberry32 (values in `[0, 1)`, uniformity). They stay as regression guards — the *determinism* test is the one that actually drove the implementation.
  - Two `toThrow()` tests (`pick([])`, `weighted([])`) passed initially for the **wrong** reason: the methods didn't exist yet, so calls threw accidentally. After implementing the methods with explicit empty-input guards, the tests kept passing for the right reason.
  - TypeScript strict mode caught a type-indexing issue in the `weighted` proportion test (a `counts` object indexed by the string return value of `rng.weighted(...)`). Fixed by typing `counts` as `Record<string, number>`.
  - The `Stats` shape is deliberately **Tier 1 only** (four stats). `Mind`, `Crit`, `Dodge` arrive in Tier 2 and will extend the interface then.
- **Touches:**
  - `src/util/rng.ts` (new)
  - `src/util/__tests__/rng.test.ts` (new)
  - `src/combat/types.ts` (new)
- **Source:** `TODO.md` Cluster A · Task 1. Related: `gdd.md` §2 (combat stats), `gdd.md` §10 (Tier 1 scope).
