# History

Completed work with the context that git history alone can't capture: decisions made, alternatives rejected, surprises encountered.

When a task in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) is finished, its entry moves here — extended with what was actually shipped, what was decided during implementation, and anything a future session (or future-you) would want to know before building on top of it.

Entries are chronological with **newest at the top**.

## Format

One section per completed task.

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD · Short title

- **What shipped:** the outcome in one or two sentences
- **Why:** the motivation (carried over from the TODO entry)
- **Decisions:** key choices made during implementation, with brief reasoning
  - *Chose X over Y because …*
- **Alternatives considered:** options explicitly looked at and rejected, with the rejection reason
- **Surprises / lessons:** anything discovered during the work that's worth remembering
- **Touches:** files / folders changed (commit SHAs optional)
- **Source:** originating TODO entry or ad-hoc note
```

Not every field is required for every entry — a small bug fix may only need *What shipped / Decisions / Touches*. Use judgement; the goal is future-useful context, not bureaucracy.
